Basic JavaScript Web Proxy
This project contains a simple but effective web proxy built with Node.js. It's designed to handle modern websites that rely heavily on JavaScript.

How It Works
index.html provides a browser-like interface where you can enter a URL.

When you submit the URL, the page sets the src of an iframe to the proxy server's endpoint.

server.js receives the request, fetches the content from the target URL, and streams it back to the iframe.

How to Run
You can run this project in two ways: on your own computer (locally) or using GitHub Codespaces.

Option 1: Running in GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
GitHub Codespaces sets everything up for you in the cloud. You don't need to install anything on your computer!

Open in Codespaces: On the project's GitHub page, click the green <> Code button, switch to the "Codespaces" tab, and click "Create codespace on main".

Wait for Setup: Codespaces will take a minute or two to build your cloud environment. It will automatically run npm install for you.

Start the Server: Once the setup is finished, a terminal will appear. Type the following command and press Enter:

npm start

Use the Proxy: Codespaces will automatically detect that the server has started and show you a notification to open it in a browser. Your proxy is now running and ready to use!

Option 2: Running on Your Own Computer
Prerequisites
You must have Node.js installed on your computer.

1. Setup
Create a project folder. Inside that folder, create a subfolder named public. You will also need a .devcontainer folder for the Codespaces configuration.

Place the files in the following structure:

/your-project-folder
├── server.js
├── package.json
├── /.devcontainer
│   ├── devcontainer.json
│   └── post-create.sh
└── /public
    └── index.html

2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your-project-folder, and run this command. This will download the necessary libraries (express, axios, cors).

npm install

3. Start the Server
Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the proxy server:

npm start

You should see a message saying: Proxy server is running on http://localhost:3000

4. Use the Proxy
Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and go to this address:

http://localhost:3000

You will see the browser UI. You can now type a URL into the address bar and press "Go" to browse through your proxy!

Limitations
Modern websites have many security features to prevent them from being embedded in iframes on other domains. While this proxy attempts to bypass some of them, you may encounter issues with highly secure sites like YouTube, Google login pages, and many banking websites. This is expected behavior and a fundamental challenge in web proxy development.
